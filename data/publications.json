    "introduction": "Reconstructing cloud-contaminated optical satellite images is vital for continuous monitoring. Despite PolSAR fusion advances, challenges like imaging gaps, speckle noise, and underused polarization hinder quality. This paper proposes PolNet-CR, a spatial-channel collaborative network with cross-scale aggregation, sparse channel optimization, and incremental collaboration for adaptive cross-domain feature fusion. A new dataset, LuojiaSET-PolCR, with PolSAR scattering features is introduced. Experiments show PolNet-CR surpasses existing methods, enabling high-fidelity, cloud-free imagery for seamless observation."
